Exploit-DB-Local-Archive-Search-Tool
====================================

This is a Ruby script I wrote to perform searches against the Exploit-DB Local Archive.
It adds some better logic to the searches over the bash version in my opinion.
It also adds some much needed color :)

Updater/Downloader now uses Github's git client and works 100 times better than before. Enjoy!

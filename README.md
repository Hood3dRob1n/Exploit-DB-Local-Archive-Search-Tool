Exploit-DB-Local-Archive-Search-Tool
====================================

This is a Ruby script I wrote to perform searches against the Exploit-DB Local Archive. 
It adds some better logic to the searches over the bash version in my opinion.
It also adds some much needed color :)

The update/downloader is not always working so might need to handle that part manually, but search works fine.
Hope its useful to someone...
